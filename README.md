# Flat-Custom-UI-Pack
Flat, blue custom UI pack for darkrp.

I made this pack for a server I was developing for, but we have no use for it anymore and I decided to share it!
This is for DarkRP and includes a scoreboard, a hud, featuring a pretty normal hud with ulx cloak detection, so the hud will tell you if you are cloaked and it will hide the head info if someone is cloaked, and head info (you know the little panel that are above player's heads)

I do have a matching thingy for Raychamp's spawn zone addon, so if you want that just ask me, show proof you own the script and I'll give you the rewritten script to match the hud theme.

The little 'Level: 0' thing above the head info was a part of my leveling system I might release soon, so stay tuned for that.

Its probably super messy, I'll still provide support for it but there is no garuntee. I know a few of the things I do in the code
is not the best and kind of lazy, anyone can contribute and if It's an improvement on my laziness or a more extensive config
option, then I'll probably accept it.
