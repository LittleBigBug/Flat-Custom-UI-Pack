# Flat-Custom-UI-Pack
Flat, blue custom UI pack for darkrp.

I made this pack for a server I was developing for, but we have no use for it anymore and I decided to share it!
This is for DarkRp and includes a scoreboard, a hud, and head info (you know the little panel that are above player's heads)

Its probably super messy, I'll still provide support for it but there is no garuntee. I know a few of the things I do in the code
is not the best and kind of lazy, anyone can contribute and if It's an improvement on my laziness or a more extensive config
option, then I'll probably accept it.

Enjoy!
